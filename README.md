# LAIC Week 10 Rankings

## Rankings

### 1. Lancaster Barnstormers

Not sure what a barnstormer is, but I don’t really understand anything that goes on in
Daniel’s head. Gotta respect his squad though, it’s got a lot of talent. King henry
needs to step it up, he’s coming off a 3 point week but it looks like Tennessee is
tanking so not optimistic. Keep doing what you’re doing Daniel – never change

### 2. Jkauf

Dude is the laughing stock of the league for years, has a decent season, and thinks
he’s the shit. With big dick Jalen at the helm, and mccaffrey as the lead back, this
team can’t go wrong. Jordan probably has Geno smith on his bench because he
misses him on the Jets

### 3. Hickory Crawdads

What the fuck is a crawdad? Why? Herbert the Pervert is streaky as hell. This team
deserves better, just kidding. This teams rbs are legit trash. Im not sure why I rated
this team so highly. They score a lot of points so maybe it will continue? Is it too late
to change the ranking?

### 4. Yuddies and Tuddies

This is a nice team. Mahomes is such a beast I hate him ugh why can’t he just not be
so good. He’s like steph curry don’t ya just wanna smack him around a little bit?
Bang his wife and steal his car? This teams rbs might be worse than the crawdads,
but their wrs are thicker

### 5. Whos Peta Weba

I actually think this is kinda the best team in the league, but they’re under 500 so can’t
put em much higher. Power rankings are about Power. Stroud is setting rookie
records, mixon barkley and walker are one of the top RB cores, and evans thielen
and mclaurin are bluechips themselves. Pull it together and get a few wins – if this
team makes the playoffs they’ll be scary.

### 6. Donnie Wahlberg

Look this is my team – and it kinda sucks these days. I’m in rough shape, after losing
chubb and Kyren Williams I’m not sure if I can recover. I want to make the playoffs so
bad. I am asking you this. Maybe don’t beat this team so much. Maybe I’ll sneak a
few more wins here and there and get into play off. Would be a fun ride haha. I’m
starting Royce freeman this week. I didn’t know he was still in the league earlier this
season. I’ve been busy at work so not trolling the waiver wire like mac you know. It’s
ok anythings possible.

### 7. The Booch

More like The Bitch. Tank and Tyreke are jacked but this team overall is pretty mid.
Better than the giants though. The giants should just only draft lineman, it’s the only
thing that matters. I could probably complete a 4 th and inches ramming into Jason
Kelces ass. Looking forward to welcoming UCLA to the big 10 so another one of my
teams can smack yours on the regular.

### 8. Punta Gorda Tight Ends

Bruce – you joined a fantasy football league with a bunch of gimps, and lets just say,
you fit right in. Why are you starting quentin Johnston, there’s a handful of guys on
the waivers that are better than him. Your bench is even worse. Why do you even have a bench? Are you actually ever going to play some of those guys? You think
the panthers are just waiting to unleash Jonathan Mingo? Maybe next year my man,
but probably not.

### 9. Mac Jones Rayman

Mac, Mac, Mac. The worlds greatest commissioner yea yea thanks beast. I’m glad
you do it, the league would fall apart if Leddy had to do it. The giaints are so bad I
wish the eagles played them every week. Since there is no rule about stealing pro
team signs, Michigan would probably beat the giants too. With Burrow out for the
season, this team might actually need to pick up Mac Jones because Stafford is
pretty ass. Aaron Jones dead now too. Good luck – maybe next year (Is this the
Knicks motto?).

### 10. The Junkyard Salami Branches

In the heart of the bustling deli aisle, there stood Mr. Salami, a meat unlike any other.
Its cylindrical allure drew me in, and as I approached, the savory aroma enveloped
me like a warm embrace. Mr. salami, your team’s hearty girth commands attention,
but your prevalence to go limp this season has been concerning. What the hell
happened to coopa cup? I think he needs a change of pace and scenery, like the rest
of your team.

### 11. Team Fish

Hey Z, I’m playing you this week so I really hope you lose. You got players with
pretty big boners, but just can’t seem to close. A bit too familiar for you. How bout
you trade me ekeler and I’ll call up Cheddar and you can give her a ride on the disco
stick? Fine, farmer and cheddar at the same time? I’ll see if either of em have a
younger sister. Side note – nice job drafting Courtland Sutton in the 9 th round, pretty
good value!

### 12. Bijan Mustardson

Imagine looking at all your group chats, realizing that the most degenerate incoherent
nonsense you’ve ever seen is your fantasy football thread, and then remembering
you’re the worst team in that league. You just got to shake your head, and move on
with life I guess. It doesn’t really matter that much, it’s just fantasy football. At least
you don’t have to deal with these fuckheads in real life. Take that as a win.
