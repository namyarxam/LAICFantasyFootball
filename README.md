# LAIC Week 5 Rankings

The moment you have all been waiting for! It’s only fitting that I am in charge of rankings this
week as I am taking the league by storm. Big shoutout to our commish Max, who’s been shaky
as a co-commish over the years – seen some great stuff from you this year, big guy!

In this week’s edition, I will add a fun little twist: 2023 QB comparisons for each team.

## Rankings

### 1. JKauff in Ya Maufff (5-0)

Not only am I the only 5-0 team in the league, but this might
be the best fantasy team ever assembled! With a perfect record and most points in the
league, it’s clear I’m the favorite to win the chip. I’m also the second best looking in the
league, only behind Zicca. We’ll see if Achane to the IR helps level the playing field
slightly, but it's truly doubtful. Can Ledy Jr. step up for the league this week?

**QB comparison: Josh Allen:** Highest fantasy upside and can go off on a week-to-week basis.
Josh Allen tends to fall short in the big moments.. will that happen to me as I go for my first
chip?

### 2. Donnie Wahlberg (4-1)

What is there really to say about Donnie everyone dislikes this
guy.. congrats on the engagement, my friend! In the past, he’s been known for his defense
and sucking the life out of every team he plays. This year, he brought in an offensive-
minded guy to run his team, and it’s paid off. Second in scoring with a killer WR duo of
Adams and Allen, will that be enough to sustain long term success? This week will be a
big test for Donnie to see if he’s a contender or just a pretender.

**QB comparison: Jalen Hurts:** Big play ability and can hurt you in different ways. Can this
level be sustained?

### 3. Lancaster Barnstormers (3-2)

Ledy Jr. comes into week 6 only 4 points behind Donnie
and has been lighting up the scoreboard recently. After a massive week 5 behind Moore,
Nacua, and Kittle, it’s clear Ledy Jr. has some BIG weapons to make a run. The big
question is, has he found his long term solution at QB? The QB carousel continues, and
that could haunt him down the stretch.

**QB comparison: Justin Herbert:** A young star in the league with massive fantasy upside. Will
the wins translate?

### 4. The Junkyard Salami Branches (3-2)

Frenchman is the lowest scoring 3-2 squad
coming into week 6 but takes the #4 spot with significant upside. While Frenchman has
been less than stellar in the past few weeks, the man, the myth, the legend, Cooper Kupp,
is back in the mix! Kupp makes this a dangerous squad moving forward if he can stay
healthy. The biggest question looking forward will be overcoming his brutal RB2.

**QB comparison: Patrick Mahomes:** The league’s gold standard but, like Frenchman, struggling to
be at the top this year with a few holes on the roster. Can things begin to click in the next few
weeks?

### 5. Who's Peat Weba? (3-2)

Coming in at our #5 spot, Mr. Jared Friedman. Peat Weba is
coming off a monster week with the highest score in week 5 despite James Conner
exiting early with an injury. Chase put up a 50-piece last week, but can he really rely on
that insane production? Jared has a ton of WR weapons, which makes him dangerous and
will keep him in the mix, but there might be reason for concern with Conner going down
and a thin RB core behind him. This week against Mac will say a lot about his team!

**QB comparison: Kirk Cousins:** One-dimensional with top 5 fantasy output. Will continue to
have big weeks but disappear if the game script is not there.

### 6. Punta Gorda Floridiots (2-3)

This week, Bruce Wallace is sneaking into my top 6
despite a below 500 record. Digging a little deeper, Punta is 4th in the league in points
and coming off a monster week 5. With Josh Allen leading the way paired with a strong
RB1/WR1, there is a lot of upside moving forward. Currently, Punta has a healthy team,
which will continue to be the biggest factor as some teams are battling major injuries.

**QB comparison: Lamar Jackson:** Explosive upside, but that hasn’t translated to wins this year-
does that change in the next few weeks?

### 7. Yuddies and Tuddies (3-2)

A freshly engaged man coming off the biggest weekend of
his life, unfortunately, did not translate to the field.. While Deano has been a force in the
league all year, he is coming off his lowest season score in week 5. On top of that, he had
two devastating blows with injuries to both JJ & Sanders (JJ being the real concern).
We’ll see if Deano can continue to put up some yuddies with these two out, but it might
be time to hit the panic button for Loverboy over here!

**QB comparison: Tua:** Homerun upside when healthy. Long term health is a big concern.

### 8. Hickory Crawdads (2-3)

Ledy!! One of our beloved commissioners over the years has
run a tight ship and turned the league into a premium fantasy destination. While his team
currently sits at 2-3, he is 5th in the league in scoring and coming off a nice week 5. He’s
gotten stellar QB play and true weapons in Diggs &amp; Kelce. The biggest question mark
with this team is his RBs. Both Pierce &amp; Stevenson have been a major letdown, and that
has been holding Ledy back from greatness.

**QB comparison: Justin Fields:** Big play ability at any moment. Boom or Bust on any given
week.

### 9. Mac Jones Rayman (2-3)

So much promise for our commish at the beginning of the
season, but it’s been subpar play to date. Despite Joe Burrow remembering how to throw
a football in week 5, Mac logged the lowest score of week 5. Health will continue to play
a major factor for Mac’s soft squad. That said, Mac will be getting Saquon back and
might be a team to look out for as a threat when healthy down the stretch.

**QB comparison: Russell Wilson:** On paper, seems strong.. something is just missing.

### 10. The Booch (2-3) 

I’m sorry I’m not at the bottom with you this year, my friend! Coming
off a solid week 5 win against a disgusting Zicca squad, there is reason to believe The
Booch can turn things around. Hill continues to be a fantasy luxury, and Fields, in the last
two weeks, is starting to break out (glad to see you playing him this week ;). Outside of
Hill, your pass catchers may be the biggest question mark on this team. You might be one
piece away from jumping up in the standings, and until then, you need to pray to the Hill
gods.

**QB comparison: Gino Smith:** Big weapons, suspect play on the field.

### 11. Bijan Mustardson (0-5)

Still searching for his first win, Bijan put up a respectable 120
spot in week 5. Besides a few bright spots, Bijan clearly lacks the depth to be a real
contender. Bijan also has 5 Cardinals on his squad, which might be a questionable
strategy from the GM.. That said, Bijan has still been competitive and could sneak a win
in there pretty soon!

**QB comparison: Bryce Young:** A lot of young talent, not clicking on the field yet.

### 12. Team Fish (1-4)

Last but not least, the real legend Zicca! Oh boy, what a disaster of a
squad this is. Riding high on a 4 game losing streak, Zicca has been outscored badly by
the entire league. Zicca does get some major weapons back this week, which could
completely change the landscape of his team. Moving forward, Ekeler and Taylor should
spice things up and hopefully change the culture in the locker room. Z is a tactical
negotiator, so don’t be surprised if he has one big move up his sleeve!

**QB comparison: Bryce Young:** Weapons around, hanging on for dear life.
