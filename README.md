# LAIC Week 1 Rankings


Week 1 is in the books, and I hope there aren't any Jets fans in this league. Have fun watching Zach Wilson for another 17 weeks.  Maybe start watching some Caleb Williams highlights?

 
## **LM Notes**

- Week 1 rankings are courtesy of Enrique
- Zicca will be venmo'd $10 from Eric for being the top scorer of the week
- Team rename is in GroupMe

## Rankings

### 1. Team Fish (144.28 pts)
Zicca comes out swinging from the pre-draft drama and drops his cock on the table with the highest weekly score (with a little help from the best defensive performance of the last decade). Maybe now that he knows his team is good he'll pay his dues?

### 2. Jkauff in Ya Mauff (144.2 pts)
Jordan's team Jkauff'd all over my team, and was second highest scorer, barely losing due to the Giants not being able to put up even 3 points. To top it off, Aaron Rodgers went down with a season ending injury after only a few plays. You'll always have this to remember Rodgers by:

On the bright side, future Jet Jordan Love looked great on Sunday. Just gotta wait another 15 years for him.



### 3. Mac Jones Rayman (124.98 pts)
Max's team barely squeaked 0ut a win, but did s0 despite Burr0w and Saqu0n's best efforts. I like his fantasy team's chances, which is m0re than I can say ab0ut the Giants. H0w much is Daniel J0nes's c0ntract again?

### 4. Yuddies and Tuddies (123.14 pts)
What fucking idiot gifted this guy Justin Jefferson with the #2 pick? Jefferson dominated the 1st half, putting up 7 catches for 138 yards. Unfortunately, Kirk Cousins is still his QB and he was quiet in the second half. Dean's team has the potential for huge boom weeks and has a good outlook for the rest of the season.

### 5. The Booch (128.94 pts)
While Jake's team 0utscored both Max and Dean, I'm bumping him d0wn a sp0t due to the insane perf0rmance required by Tyreek to get him here.  And an0ther sp0t f0r n0t having Bijan R0bins0n 0n his team.

### 6. The Junkyard Salami Branches
Solid week with a little bit of luck for Zach, with matchup luck going his way. The roster's outlook looks solid, as long as Lamar learns how to throw a football again.  Maybe he just had to take a huge shit?

### 7. Who's Peat Weba? (111.08 pts)
Since I joined the league last year, I've thought the same thing: Who the fuck is Peat Weba? The answer alludes me to this day and Google is no help. Maybe the real Peat Weba was the friends we made along the way?

### 8. Bijan Mustardson
I may have lost this week on the scoreboard, but at least Bijan had a sick touchdown.  Not alot of bright spots for me this week--the Cardinals also lost to the Commanders while a make-a-wish kid played QB. At least we get the Giants next week, which is a guaranteed win.

### 9. Captain McCackle (91.42 pts)

I mean listen Eric got Travis fucking Kelce in the second round. We all watched that Thursday game, Mahomes has fucking milkmen at WR. This man's team is stacked once Kelce comes back and gets 15+ targets a game.  Week 1 loss is just a small bump en route the playoffs and potentially a championship.

### 10. Punta Gorda Floridiots (90.94 pts)

Josh Allen fucking sucks. Who's comparing this guy to Mahomes? I swear every time he throws the ball downfield its a 50/50 chance to be a pick, and everytime he runs it looks like he's going to get injured. After how Zach Wilson played last night, Allen might be the worst QB in the AFC East. 

Sidenote: Punta Gorda is a city?  That comes dangerously close to translating to "Fat Bitch" in spanish--Florida's really playing with fire there.

### 11. Chark Week (82.96)

Tough week, with not alot of saving grace on the bench.  I believe in the turnaround though--Derrick Henry should be back to plowing next week and this roster was involved in alot of blowouts.  The players should get more opportunities as the season goes on. Except for Najee, that guy blows.

In an efford to find a gif, I found this. Browns fans are fucked up LMAO.

### 12. Donnie Wahlberg (102.34)

Now I know Brandon's team is 1-0, so why is he 12th?  Not only did he have the lowest points in a win (his 102 would have lost against 9 other league members), this man is a Philadelphia AND Boston sports fan?  Now I'm not from the Northeast US, but isn't this basically a crime?  What is going on?  On that alone I'm docking you to the bottom.  Don't even get me started on the Celtics signing a guy who can't go left to a $300m extension.

At least you got the Eagles.
