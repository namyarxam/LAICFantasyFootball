## **Week 2 LAIC Rankings**

- Week 5 rankings courtesy of Zicca.
- Daniel (once again) has been paid $10 for being the weekly top scorer.  

___
## **Week 2 Rename**:

Max's team name "**_RJ Barrett_**" has been renamed to "**_Renaldo Balkman_**".

As noted in GroupMe, team names last (at least) 2 weeks. You can keep your name if you want. 
___

### 1. Big Brown Chu.bb Hurts? [4-1]

> Another W for the highest scoring team in the league by a long shot. This team is buoyed by a trio of Grade A junkyard dogs in Chubb, Henry, and Hurts.
However, if one of those dogs gets put down, this team could be vulnerable as those receivers. 

>**a. Offense Rank: 1**

>**b. Defense Rank: 2**
___

### 2. The Junkyard Salami Branches [4-1]

> The deli was serving up Hard Salami again this week. Keep those extra thick slices coming big boy.

>**a. Offense Rank: 3**

>**b. Defense Rank: 1**
___

### 3. Fire Kliff Into the Sun [3-2]

> The man with a hard-on for Kliff Kingsbury is coming off a tough loss. Maybe direct your anger to his bimbo girlfriend instead? (spoiler alert – the buns don’t look
real either)

>**a. Offense Rank: 2**

>**b. Defense Rank: 9**

___

### 4. Punta Gorda Floridiots? [3-2]

> There’s a lot of beef on this team, but none beefier than that Stallion below.

>**a. Offense Rank: 4**

>**b. Defense Rank: 6**

![Kupp](https://i.imgur.com/aaKujRR.png)
___

### 5. Team Fish [3-2]

> Top dog Davante Adams is likely facing a suspension for “assaulting” that cameraman in yesterday’s MNF game, although Missouri’s very own “Worlds of Fun” theme
park took no time banning his black ass. However, the never-ending story has been what the
hell is going with Tom Brady, who has been losing bitches left and right. Whether it was the
100% sane Antonio Brown last year, Toothless Cole Beasley last week (who has now
subsequently retired), or his Brazilian hothead of a wife Gisele, the man has seemingly lost it. TB
needs to watch out, cause AB’s coming for his wife. 

>**a. Offense Rank: 6**

>**b. Defense Rank: 4**

___

### 6. Donnie Wahlberg [1-4]

> It breaks my heart to see the Farm gone and Donnie back, but
hopefully the change leads to some W’s considering you just picked up your first. Despite that,
the Burnout’s team is actually pretty good and has faced some tough opponents. While he was
tripping on some acid, the Meat to my Potatoes did his own rankings last night as shown
below…

![BrandonGroupMe](https://i.imgur.com/1Wj62zt.png)

>**a. Offense Rank: 5**

>**b. Defense Rank: 10**
___

### 7. The Booch [3-2]

> After your big trade with J-Kauff last week, Darren Waller rewarded you with
a hearty 0 points. To make matters worse, a tough week lies ahead as you have the lowest
points projection as of writing this. Justin Fields as your QB sums it up.

>**a. Offense Rank: 7**

>**b. Defense Rank: 11**
___

### 8. Skittles Up My White Ba-ss [2-3]

> Your team is as boring as the state you live in. And shame on you for adding Bill Cosby to your roster. I don’t know what the fuck where you doing here –
trying to match your transaction count with the number of sexual assaults this dog has?

>**a. Offense Rank: 8**

>**b. Defense Rank: 5**

![LedTransactions](https://i.imgur.com/GGUhwLw.png)
___

### 9. Yuddies and Tuddies [2-3]

> After two straight wins, the Bean has now lost 3 straight. Just like his Mets, this one looks like a loser.

>**a. Offense Rank: 9**

>**b. Defense Rank: 3**
___

### 10. Renaldo Balkman [4-1]

> Your team needs as much help as it does luck going forward. Your RBs are playing like trash, and your WRs look tired. Maybe you can call upon your whiney bitch brother Zach to help you? Be warned though as he might cancel you like he did this league…

>**a. Offense Rank: 11**

>**b. Defense Rank: 12**
___

### 11. JKauff In Ya Mauf [2-3]

> I hope you’re looking forward to your upcoming 30 th birthday party in
New Orleans that I recently heard about, cause you ain’t got shit to celebrate here. Just make
sure you invite the entire league 😀

>**a. Offense Rank: 12**

>**b. Defense Rank: 8**
___

### 12. Who's Peat Weba? [1-4]

> Deprived of talent, this loser of 3 straight games appears to be the trash can of this league. Only one person truly believes in Geno Smith, and that’s Geno Smith.

>**a. Offense Rank: 10**

>**b. Defense Rank: 7**

## **Week 3 LAIC Rankings**

- Week 3 rankings courtesy of Leddy! Enjoy!
- Daniel has been paid $10 for being the weekly top scorer. 

___
## **Week 3 Rename**:

Jkauff's team name "**_Jkauff in Ya Mauf_**" has been renamed to "**_Emotional Participant_**".

Brandon's team is now elgible to be re-named back, and he immediately changed his name back the second he could. That's how we know it was a good name, lets get more of that! 

____

### 1. Big Brown Chu.bb Hurts? [2-1]

> This big brown man has a big fat cock. Leading the league in points by a wide margin
after 3 weeks, things are looking very erect. I would say the sky is the limit, but there is
no limit on the growth of this man’s cock. Every week it just keeps and growing and
growing. I want you to win every week because getting these hilarious write-ups on new
team namings is money well spent. Emotional Participant? What the fuck is that name?
No idea, but I fucking love it! Please keep winning, I beg you.


### 2. The Junkyard Salami Branches [3-0]

> Following up the Big Brown fat cocks are the Salami cocks. Just like this thick piece of
meat’s Johnny Tsunami hair, this cockman’s branches are growing wildly. Growth! Thick!
Thick Cock! Look at those ceps! Rock hard calves!

![Zach](https://i.imgur.com/mZdB7Gw.png)


### 3. Stiff For Kliff [2-1]

> Following up on the first 2 cocks is another cock. Just have to name your team after a
cock and you’ll be good.


### 4. A Hardman in My Butker [2-1]

> Heeeeemmm! Aaaaaaat! Aiiiiiiyyyuuuttt! Siirrrr! Ohhh Thinkington! Thickle! Flickin the
Beano!


### 5. The Booch [2-1]

> Kid’s got ‘ceps


### 6. Punta Gorda Floridiots [2-1]

> Looking good Bruce! Keep up the good work!


### 7. Team Fish [1-2]

> Living life as a recluse, this man may literally never witness the light of day, but the
brightness from his laptop screen as he’s tugging away will forever put him at peace
with his reality.


### 8. Skittles Up My White Ba-ss [1-2]

> This Workaholic Redneck Texan lives in three places: apartment, car, work repeat. The
team got off to a slow start but smoked a nice fat dub this week.


### 9. Emotional Participant [2-2]

> This past week, this team was as pathetic as Dave Kaufman’s failed science expert. His
tennis career ended abruptly just like his chances for success this year in fantasy. His
epic defeats just caught up to him and he fizzled out real quick. He couldn’t take the
emotional toll anymore after realizing Eric Halpern and Kyle Berman were far superior.
His failures year after year in this league are evidence that his father’s disappointment
still haunts him to this day.


### 10. Who's Peat Weba? [1-2]

> Coming in 10 th place is the man who received a $1 million inheritance from his father at
age 20 and takes all the credit. He is never afraid to boast about his Columbia Master’s
Degree, talk up his Big Boy Job at Deloitte on LinkedIn or drop a minimum $250 on a
mediocre NY Steak House. Don’t worry, we still love you Jared <3. Carson Wentz sucks
as a real life quarterback, but somehow is actually pretty good at fantasy. Mark Andrews
is looking like a great pick too.


### 11. McKissic My Big Brown Chubb in Ya Mauf [1-2]

> Your team looked like it was going to be the best after the draft was over, but man, your
wide receivers and James Connor are really shit. Maybe you should recruit ZRayman to
run your team the rest of the year. Plus I miss his bitching about unfair trades in the chat
and want to bring that back.


### 12. Donnie Wahlberg [0-3]

> A heartfelt win by my team against yours this week just to keep you in your place at the
bottom in this league felt so, so, gratifying. Jordan’s teams have traditionally sucked in
this league, but never to the degree this Burnout’s have. Year after Year after Year, we
witness the same and it is a beautiful thing.
Here’s one for books:

## **Week 2 LAIC Rankings**

- Week 2 rankings courtesy of Zicca. Each weeks rankings will be totally different, I don't tell anyone what to or how to format their rankings. 
- Daniel has been paid $10 for being the weekly top scorer. 

___
## **Week 2 Rename**:

Max's team name "**_Daniel Negroni_**" has been renamed to "**_Mckissic my BB chu.bbInYaMauff_** 😭".

As noted in GroupMe, team names last (at least) 2 weeks. You can keep your name if you want. 

____

### 1. Big Brown Chu.bb Hurts? [1-1]

> The Chubb definitely hurt for Bruce as Leddy Jr. scored the
most points last week at 171. Daniel has a solid team all around and will be dangerous once
Godwin comes back. However, former top junkyard dog Derrick Henry is looking tired these days
and may need a tug to wake him up...


### 2. Hardman In My Butker [2-0]

> The Beano is “doin’ good” after he slapped Team Fish this week,
led by stallion Josh Allen. Anchored by co-stallion C-Mac, this team has a lot of star power with
the emergence of Waddle but doesn’t have great WR dept thereafter. Nonetheless, I’m liking
what I see and am giving this team a hard buy.


### 3. Stiff For Kliff [1-1]

> Both Justin Jefferson and Saquon Barkley failed to repeat their strong performances in the L against the Salami Branches. However, at least Kliff Kingsbury picked up
the W last week. Enrique’s team definitely has potential, but it’s too early to determine whether
it sinks or floats.


### 4. The Booch [2-0]

> After a tight win last week against Team Farmer, Alessandro Bucci has muted
the haters with a 2-0 start. St. Brown has picked up where he left off late last year, looking like a
true WR1. However, while Jake’s team is loaded at WR, the team is weak at RB. For a team that
is usually full of RBs, this makes for an interesting change in strategy this year.


### 5. The Junkyard Salami Branches [2-0]

> Not sure this fuck boy even knows what week we’re on,
but he picked up another W. Expect the bare minimum of work from Zach, but more wins led by
junkyard dog Lamar Jackson.


### 6. Punta Gorda Floridiots [1-1]

> Despite the L last week, Bruce’s team is jacked on paper and has
tons of potential. Mahomes is proving he can still dominate without Tyreke Hill, and Kupp is
continuing to catch dimes from Stafford.


### 7. Who’s Peat Weba? [1-1]

> Jared’s team looks like a good .500 team. Solids RBs, great TE, but
lacks any high ceiling WR. Maybe his team name should be changed to Who’s Carson Wentz,
since the league still doesn’t know…


### 8. JKauff In Ya Mauf [1-1]

> Desperate for recognition these days, the former tennis star picked up
the W last week against a poor performance by The Commissioner. Despite what he wants you
to believe, Jordan’s team is full of inconsistent players, making this one a tough buy.


### 9. Team Fish [1-1]

> This team may be a joke, just like the financial advisor turned serial
entrepreneur turned sex therapist it’s named after. Tom Brady looks washed up and should’ve
stayed retired.


### 10. I Miss Rachel Farmer [0-2]

> B’s team has solid talent on paper. But like it’s manager, it took
too many drugs last week and passed out to an 0-2 start despite scoring 146 points in a slim loss
against The Booch. Perhaps B and his former lover Rachel Farmer could use a slice of Brie
“Bestario” Cheddar to give him a boost next week against Leddy Sr.


### 11. Skittles Up My White Ba-ss [0-2]

> While Leddy Sr. and Team Skittles are not looking too good
to start the season winless, the talent is definitely there. Eric is large and in charge at RB, but the
team may need a new QB as Stafford looks washed up with that potentially bad elbow. Shout
out for his great pick of Michael Thomas, who looks fresh catching passes from Bill Cosby.


### 12. Mckissic my BB chu.bbInYaMauff [0-2]

> New name, same problems. The Commissioner may
have the best RB in the game, but his WRs are trash especially with Evans out this week.
However, a W for Max is in the cards going against the lowly Team Fish this week.

## **Week 1 LAIC Rankings**

- Week 1 is in the books for the start of the NFL season and the start of the LAIC fantasy league. Normally theres a lot to say about week 1 surprises but honestly things are very unsurprising after just one week. Tom Brady is still dominating, the Giants are undefeated, and Geno Smith looked great in his commanding win on MNF. 

- Rankings this week are going to be formatted similar to how I've done a couple in the past: with one standout player, one letdown, and maybe a brief synposis. 

- As a reminder next week the rankings will be handled by Zicca and the following week by Ledner. 

- Week 1 payout of $10 has been sent to Enrique.

___

## **Week 1 Rename**:

Brandon's team "**_Donnie Wahlberg_**" has been renamed to "**_I Miss Rachel Farmer_** 😭".

If you don't get the reference feel free to ask him! 

___



### 1. Stiff for Kliff **[1-0]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Justin Jefferson (39.4)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Trey Lance (9.96)

> The new kid on the block dominates week 1. Beginners luck, but I have to rank him here for now because he shit on everyone this week. This kid is a Cardinals fan who lives in Utah so let's just let him be happy for 1 good thing going for him. Lets revisit this in a couple of weeks when that bum Jefferson falls off to my boy Adam Thielen the stallion. 

___

### 2. Team Fish **[1-0]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Michael Pittman Jr (27.1) 

- **SMALL PLAYER**: DeVonta Smith (0)

> Happy belated B-day Zicca! Is your team name "Team Fish" because you like sushi so much? We should all go sometime. Zicca's team is solid, he has 3 WRs who can easily end the league top-10 which is a recipe for success. Not sure what he's going to do about the goose egg from DeVonta, maybe there will be a sign in the breading of the next batch of cutlets he fries up. 

___

### 3. A Hardman In My Butker **[1-0]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Javonte Williams (19.8)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Christian McCaffrey (15.7)

> It was always Javonte Williams. 11 fucking catches he might as well be McCaffery's father this week. Pretty lucky win this week vs. my squad, but Keenan Allen got hurt and Dean's bench is pretty fucking dried up so I dropped him down a spot this week from the point totals. Also in case you guys didn't see from the 57 news articles that were posted 15 seconds after it happened, Harrison Butker stubbed his toe during the game. 

___

### 4. Punta Gorda Floridiots **[1-0]** 

- **BIG PLAYER**: Cooper Kupp (31.8)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Ezekiel Elliot (5.9) 

> Is Bruce a Punta Gorda Floridiot or are those his students after this year? A lot of bozo performances on this team, Bruces RB1 + TE + D/ST + K combined for a total of...8 points. Thankfully he had a free matchup against a G league roster this week, and a lot of other players went off so when things even out this team should remain solid. 

___

### 5. The Junkyard Salami Branches **[1-0]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Antonio Gibson (20.0)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Alvin Kamara (7.6)

> I **FOUND** this week to be quite... **TITAN**ic from Zach. Thankfully his performance last year will give him some **ARMOR** to build upon win after win. Antonio Gibson proved to be very **BEAST**ly and the **COLOSSAL** **ATTACK**s from Travis Kelce seem to be the start of something great. As long as none of his players get **CART**ed off this year, Zach will be able to continue to enjoy the **FEMALE**s he is going on dates with and giving **JAW** soreness to night after night. 

___

### 6. Daniel Negroni **[0-1]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Jonathan Taylor (27.5)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Bobby Trees (2.3)

> The 4th highest scoring team this week, the only team with a loss out of the top 7 highest scoring teams. Unlucky start, but me and Daniel Jones are taking the chip this year. 

___

### 7. Who's Peat Weba? **[0-1]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Gabe Davis (18.8)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Dak Prescott (4.46)

> The worst loss of the week goes to Jared, who lost by 0.84 points with a generally solid performance all around except for Dak getting hurt. Jared is one of the few teams in the league without a backup QB rostered, which doesnt bode well for him in general. Unfortunately Jared was too busy smoking his vape and coming up with 'experimental' draft strategies in this league to put together a good enough team to start the season with a win.

___

### 8. The Booch **[1-0]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Stefon Diggs (26.2)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Allen Robinson (2.2)

> I'm surprised Ja'Marr Chase  still hasnt torn his ACL yet. Jake somehow only won by less than a point against a guy whos QB played 5 minutes after 2 terrible performances by Rashaad Penny and Noah Fant on Monday. I really think this team and his two-pronged QB attack of Trevor Lawrence and Justin Fields has some work to do before its considered a good team. Jake's team reminds me of the Giants this week, a shit performance but a wins a win. Give me another shitty win and maybe I'll give you a few more ranking spots. 

___

### 9. Big Brown Chu.bb Hurts? **[0-1]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Nick Chubb (15.3)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: CeDee Lamb (4.9)

> Daniel's team name is great, but his player's are not. I literally had trouble picking a good player this week because basically everyone played average or worse besides his defense. Not even his bench did anything good. This disgrace of a team somehow was not the lowest scoring team this week thanks to Jalen Hurts' Big Brown Chubb. 

___

### 10. JKaufff In Ya Mauf **[0-1]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: AJ Brown (25.5)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Mike Williams (3.0)

> I feel like I've done this before but it feels like tradition. The Jets put up 35 points in a loss and yet everyone knows they are just a hopeless franchise. When I see JKauf starting week 1 with a loss my mind goes to teams like the Jets and their history of failure and I just have to drop him down to a super low ranking. I see JKauf already making IR moves and guys like Mike Williams are poised to have a huge come-up but I couldnt resist putting your sorry ass franchise of a team down here at #10 for this week ❤️.

___

### 11. Skittles Up My White Ba-ss **[0-1]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Michael Thomas (22.7)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Irv Smith Jr. (0)

> Why would I rank your team? What about the opportunity cost I lose from not being able to do other things during that time period of me writing the rankings for your team? Who the fuck is Irv Smith Jr. and why is he on your team? Thankfully Eric's team two flex spots went batshit crazy this week or he would have had his team re-named and let me tell you the opportunity for renaming Eric's team are endless. 

___

### 12. I Miss Rachel Farmer 😭 **[0-1]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Tyreek Hill (18.0)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Cam Akers (0.0)

> Brandon came in last place (by alot), lost in his college league, and lost week 1 of his survival pool (he picked the Colts). At least you'll be able to focus on your new job considering it seems like there wont be any real distractions from the world of sports for the next few months. I really can't think of anything good to say about your team because it was just that bad, but I hope you like your new team name! 

___

That's all for this week, thanks for reading! Next weeks edition will be brought to you by the one and only Alexa Zicca AKA Zesus himself. Stay tuned!
