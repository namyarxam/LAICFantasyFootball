# Week 1 LAIC Rankings

Week 1 is in the books for the start of the NFL season and the start of the LAIC fantasy league. Normally theres a lot to say about week 1 surprises but honestly things are very unsurprising after just one week. Tom Brady is still dominating, the Giants are undefeated, and Geno Smith looked great in his commanding win on MNF. 

Rankings this week are going to be formatted similar to how I've done a couple in the past: with one standout player, one letdown, and maybe a brief synposis. 

As a reminder next week the rankings will be handled by Zicca and the following week by Ledner.
