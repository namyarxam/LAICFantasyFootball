# LAIC Week 4 Rankings

Folks,

We're now through ~25% of the season.  I'd love to write a thoroughly-researched, thought-provoking dissertation on the state of each roster, but I clearly lack the requisite football insight.  Here are some hockey GIFs:

## **LM Notes**

- Week 4 rankings are courtesy of Jake
- Bruce will be been paid $10 for coming in first place this week. 
- Team rename will be in GroupMe.
- To avoid scuffed rankings in the future e-mail me at mxray333@gmail.com with the rankings so I can put them here.
- *NOTE*: Half of the clips Jake sent me were GIFs (which work) and half were videos (which dont in the simple website format I made) so sorry for the links but it is what it is.
