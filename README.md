## Rankings

### 1. Team Fish (2-6)

In an attempt to lose the little bit of credibility I have in this league, I will intentionally avoid talking about anything football specific and Z man gets the top spot this week! Anyone that‚Äôs packing a 12 inch salami branch is #1 in my book. After blowing his load points wise this week (albeit in a fat L to J kauf) it looks like this team has turned a corner and is ready to pounce on everybody under the age of 12 üåö Not sure they can get back in the playoff picture, but don‚Äôt expect Z to go out quietly. He still has some unfinished business to attend to with our ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù commissioner and a pay per view boxing match might be in the works for the duo. Vote for who you think takes that match in groupme. 

### 2. JKaufff In Ya Maufff (7-1)

This squad is looking like the Backstreet Boys in their prime with a head coach on a mission this year. This man has been in the trenches year after year so it‚Äôs nice to see him in contention finally. If coach Kauf keeps levelheaded and refrains from checking his man scale rating these guys will go all the way.

### 3. Yuddies and Tuddies (5-3)

I‚Äôm feeling bullish on Deano üôÇ and you should be too. This newly engaged stud muffin is coming off of two big wins and should be feeling pretty good going into a matchup with Peat Weba. Look for Deano to be raking in a W and shitposting on wall street bets this week.

### 4. Hickory Crawdads (4-4)

This guy fucks. Simple as that. King of Cocktopia. He‚Äôs got the stallion of all stallions in Kelce and after a rough start to the season has plans to ram his meat rod through a brick wall. If he stays in the playoff picture he‚Äôs gonna be a tough out. COCK!

### 5. Donnie Wahlberg (6-2)

Donnie took a tumble this week, but don‚Äôt worry he‚Äôs still got a rock cock. That Chubb might not stay up for much longer though. I think that injury is going to bite him more as the season goes on, but still a contender 

### 6. The Booch (5-3)

The booch recovered his pistol whip from behind the dumpster at Fernando‚Äôs Pizza and has been causing havoc lately. Easy matchup this week for him so look for this Italian goon to possibly steal 2nd place soon

### 7. Mac Jones Rayman (4-4)

I‚Äôm still waiting for this ‚Äúfantasy football wizard‚Äù to really impress me one year üôÇ. He's got two joysticks to tend to (one for gaming and one for tugging) so I understand his priorities might lie elsewhere, but I can still see this team surprising us with some good fortune. Let‚Äôs see how the big trade shakes out before making a definitive statement on Mac‚Äôs season.

### 8. Lancaster Barnstormers (4-4)

The last time I saw Daniel he basically shit himself at a bar as a defensive tactic to clear a crowded area. His team has that same kind of dog in them and a pretty balanced attack week after week. Could see them going far with some luck.

### 9. Who‚Äôs Peat Weba (3-5)

The J-man put up a lot of points this week, but unfortunately it was not enough to get a W. After getting dicked down by lil Led this smooth criminal was last spotted selling his pubic hair on Facebook marketplace. For teams like this on the brink, we‚Äôre at the point in the season where one more loss could mean disaster. I still think these guys can sneak into the playoffs, but gonna need a BIG win against Deano this week to get back in the race. 

### 10. Punta Gorda Tight Ends (3-5)

Disappointing season so far, the lower playoff seeds are wide open though so a lil win streak can turn the tide.

### 11. Bijan Mustardson (1-7)

This team stinks.

### 12. The Junkyard Salami Branches (4-4)

Blue collar .500 team with nothing special to write home about. This iteration of the salami branches is still very much in the hunt for a playoff spot, but I don‚Äôt see them making much noise unless their white stallion wakes up. A bunch of tired players in need of a tug. The ZvZ matchup this week is an important one for both teams this weeküåö
