## Rankings

### 1. JKauff in Ya Maufff (6-1)

That’s right – another week, another first place spot by the
league’s historically worst player. No longer undefeated after that L last week, this “7”
has a muscle-packed “8” blowing smoke right behind him…

- PF – 1 st place
- PA – 6 th place

### 2. Donnie Wahlberg (6-1)

B is ranked the same number as Donnie is to the Wahlberg
Bros– 2 nd . Only in his drug-infested brain Donnie &gt; Mark (reference – Oscar-worthy
movies Boogie Nights and Daddy’s Home).

- PF – 2 nd place
- PA – 2 nd place

### 3. Hickory Crawdads (4-3)

If you’re still looking for my $10 “penalty” payment, you should
know I sent it via Donkey courier to Hamas.

- PF – 3 rd place
- PA – 10 th place

### 4. Yuddies and Tuddies (4-3) 

It’s time to send Christopha to beat the shit out of OnlyFan’s
newest whooore, [Adriana](https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sopranos-star-drea-de-matteo-joins-onlyfans-after-labeled-savage-by-hollywood-not-accepting-defeat). Maybe send in Artie Bucco as well.

- PF – 6 th place
- PA – 1 st place 

### 5. The Junkyard Salami Branches (4-3)

Another successful year with zero effort or
knowledge put into playin’ the game (a league-low 2 moves). It must be nice to be a
born stallion.

- PF – 7 th place
- PA – 3 rd place

I think it’s time to spice up your team. Maybe some Gucci for Boochi?

### 9. Mac Jones Rayman (3-4)

On September 27, 2023, Counter-Strike 2 was released to the
world. The Enemy (you) has unleashed a barrage of fire alongside your proxy, Jack
Wellington. A ground invasion looms…

- PF – 8 th place
- PA – 4 th place
