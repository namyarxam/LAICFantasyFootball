## **Week 1 LAIC Rankings**

- Week 1 is in the books for the start of the NFL season and the start of the LAIC fantasy league. Normally theres a lot to say about week 1 surprises but honestly things are very unsurprising after just one week. Tom Brady is still dominating, the Giants are undefeated, and Geno Smith looked great in his commanding win on MNF. 

- Rankings this week are going to be formatted similar to how I've done a couple in the past: with one standout player, one letdown, and maybe a brief synposis. 

- As a reminder next week the rankings will be handled by Zicca and the following week by Ledner. 

- Week 1 payout of $10 has been sent to Enrique.

___



### 1. Stiff for Kliff **[1-0]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Justin Jefferson (39.4)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Trey Lance (9.96)

> The new kid on the block dominates week 1. Beginners luck, but I have to rank him here for now because he shit on everyone this week. This kid is a Cardinals fan who lives in Utah so let's just let him be happy for 1 good thing going for him. Lets revisit this in a couple of weeks when that bum Jefferson falls off to my boy Adam Thielen the stallion. 

___

### 2. Team Fish **[1-0]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Michael Pittman Jr (27.1) 

- **SMALL PLAYER**: DeVonta Smith (0)

> Happy belated B-day Zicca! Is your team name "Team Fish" because you like sushi so much? We should all go sometime. Zicca's team is solid, he has 3 WRs who can easily end the league top-10 which is a recipe for success. Not sure what he's going to do about the goose egg from DeVonta, maybe there will be a sign in the breading of the next batch of cutlets he fries up. 

___

### 3. A Hardman In My Butker **[1-0]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Javonte Williams (19.8)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Christian McCaffrey (15.7)

> It was always Javonte Williams. 11 fucking catches he might as well be McCaffery's father this week. Pretty lucky win this week vs. my squad, but Keenan Allen got hurt and Dean's bench is pretty fucking dried up so I dropped him down a spot this week from the point totals. Also in case you guys didn't see from the 57 news articles that were posted 15 seconds after it happened, Harrison Butker stubbed his toe during the game. 

___

### 4. Punta Gorda Floridiots **[1-0]** 

- **BIG PLAYER**: Cooper Kupp (31.8)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Ezekiel Elliot (5.9) 

> Is Bruce a Punta Gorda Floridiot or are those his students after this year? A lot of bozo performances on this team, Bruces RB1 + TE + D/ST + K combined for a total of...8 points. Thankfully he had a free matchup against a G league roster this week, and a lot of other players went off so when things even out this team should remain solid. 

___

### 5. The Junkyard Salami Branches **[1-0]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Cooper Kupp (31.8)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Ezekiel Elliot (5.9) 

> I **FOUND** this week to be quite... **TITAN**ic from Zach. Thankfully his performance last year will give him some **ARMOR** to build upon win after win. Antonio Gibson proved to be very **BEAST**ly and the **COLOSSUS** **ATTACK**s from Travis Kelce seem to be the start of something great. As long as none of his players get **CART**ed off this year, Zach will be able to continue to enjoy the **FEMALE**s he is going on dates with and giving **JAW** soreness to night after night. 

___

### 6. Daniel Negroni **[0-1]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Jonathan Taylor (27.5)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Bobby Trees (2.3)

> The 4th highest scoring team this week, the only team with a loss out of the top 7 highest scoring teams. Unlucky start, but me and Daniel Jones are taking the chip this year. 

___

### 8. Who's Peat Weba? **[0-1]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Gabe Davis (18.8)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Dak Prescott (4.46)

> The worst loss of the week goes to Jared, who lost by 0.84 points with a generally solid performance all around except for Dak getting hurt. Jared is one of the few teams in the league without a backup QB rostered, which doesnt bode well for him in general. Unfortunately Jared was too busy smoking his vape and coming up with 'experimental' draft strategies in this league to put together a good enough team to start the season with a win.

___

### 8. The Booch **[1-0]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Stefon Diggs (26.2)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Allen Robinson (2.2)

> I'm surprised Ja'Marr Chase  still hasnt torn his ACL yet. Jake somehow only won by less than a point against a guy whos QB played 5 minutes after 2 terrible performances by Rashaad Penny and Noah Fant on Monday. I really think this team and his two-pronged QB attack of Trevor Lawrence and Justin Fields has some work to do before its considered a good team. Jake's team reminds me of the Giants this week, a shit performance but a wins a win. Give me another shitty win and maybe I'll give you a few more ranking spots. 

___

### 9. Big Brown Chu.bb Hurts? **[0-1]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Nick Chubb (15.3)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: CeDee Lamb (4.9)

> Daniel's team name is great, but his player's are not. I literally had trouble picking a good player this week because basically everyone played average or worse besides his defense. Not even his bench did anything good. This disgrace of a team somehow was not the lowest scoring team this week thanks to Jalen Hurts' Big Brown Chubb. 

___

### 10. JKaufff In Ya Mauf **[0-1]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: AJ Brown (25.5)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Mike Williams (3.0)

> I feel like I've done this before but it feels like tradition. The Jets put up 35 points in a loss and yet everyone knows they are just a hopeless franchise. When I see JKauf starting week 1 with a loss my mind goes to teams like the Jets and their history of failure and I just have to drop him down to a super low ranking. I see JKauf already making IR moves and guys like Mike Williams are poised to have a huge come-up but I couldnt resist putting your sorry ass franchise of a team down here at #10 for this week ❤️.

___

### 11. Skittles Up My White Ba-ss **[0-1]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Michael Thomas (22.7)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Irv Smith Jr. (0)

> Why would I rank your team? What about the opportunity cost I lose from not being able to do other things during that time period of me writing the rankings for your team? Who the fuck is Irv Smith Jr. and why is he on your team? Thankfully Eric's team two flex spots went batshit crazy this week or he would have had his team re-named and let me tell you the opportunity for renaming Eric's team are endless. 

___

### 12. I Miss Rachel Farmer 😭 **[0-1]**

- **BIG PLAYER**: Tyreek Hill (18.0)

- **SMALL PLAYER**: Cam Akers (0.0)

> Brandon came in last place (by alot), lost in his college league, and lost week 1 of his survival pool (he picked the Colts). At least you'll be able to focus on your new job considering it seems like there wont be any real distractions from the world of sports for the next few months. I really can't think of anything good to say about your team because it was just that bad, but I hope you like your new team name!
