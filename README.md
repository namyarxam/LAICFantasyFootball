# LAIC Week 3 Rankings

Okay fuckers Max told me that it’s my week to do the rankings. Out of respect for the big man I am prioritizing these rankings over the league I actually commission. Ledner is in both leagues and will probably squeal on me for being a bad commissioner. But enough about the human calculator.  Congrats to Brando on his engagement! When you said you were proposing I legit thought you were proposing that we come over and watch football. Also congrats on having Devante Adams and Kennan Allen. But mostly congrats on the proposal.

## **LM Notes**

- Week 3 rankings are courtesy of Jared
- Brandon has been paid $20 for coming in first place last week and this week. 
- Team rename will be in GroupMe.
- To avoid scuffed rankings in the future e-mail me at mxray333@gmail.com with the rankings so I can put them here.

## Rankings

### 1. JKauff in Ya Maufff

In a surprise twist I am giving Jkauff the top spot. Why? Because of consistency. He has scored roughly 140 points every week like clockwork. That is in spite of Deandre Hopkins forgetting how to catch and Kyle Pitts continuing to be a tease. He also gets Kamara back this week Ayuk wont be hurt forever. Anyway we play this week, so fuck you and how about Zach Wilson?

### 2. Donnie Wahlberg

See my opening paragraph. If the Raiders game plan is just gonna be throw it Devante Adams, I think you’ll be okay. Keenan also should continue to stay hot since Mike Williams died again.

### 3. Mac Jones Rayman 

Mac has Raheem Mostert so I am going to assume that he won his matchup this past week. Thanks again for drafting for me in my other league buddy. For a team that is dealing with an injured Saquan Max remains scary due to him having the dolphins primary ball carrier. Plus it’s Mac. Idk what else the man does with his time besides football, video games, discord and twitch.

### 4. Yuddies and Tuddies 

Dean is the only other team that has scored over 400+ points through the first weeks. He has Justin Jefferson, Patrick Mahomes. It hasn’t been splashy, but he is scoring points. Kinda feels like you need Williams or Montgomery to come back for stability but YOLO good luck against Jake.

### 5. Starchfeld Lardstinkers 

Hey Daniel. How’s Colorado? Are you enjoy it out there? How is the weather? Is it cold? Your fantasy team is 2-1 and your running backs are pretty good. Your fantasy team name sucks. Have a good night.

### 6. The Booch

I am sorry but Joe Burrow will figure it out. Tee Higgins will be productive, this man has Tyreek Hill and while Justin Fields may suck for real life purposes, he will be productive in fantasy until they either trade him or draft another QB. Don’t sleep on the Booch.

### 7. Who's Peat Weba? 

Are we all familiar with Pete Webber the bowler? If you are not familiar with my namesake here is a refresher https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G74ZHWcsbgc. Anywho I do not love having half of the Bengals offense as the cornerstone of my team, but I believe in Joe Burrow. Hopefully Adam Thielen continues his career resurgence or else I am fucked.

### 8. Junkyard Salami Dogs

Okay I had to remind myself that Zach has Cooper Kupp. Once Kupp is back I am scared of his team. Until that time he has a bunch of wide receivers that he should probably trade to upgrade his RB2 position. Dalvin Cook?! Yikes.

### 9. Captain McCackle 

What is there to say. You are 0-3 but I still believe in you. Your roster is solid and you just did blow you’re while wad on Ford. You also get to face your brother this weekend. HOW FUN! Did I tell you both of my sisters are playing fantasy football this year? Do you know what that equates to? Them sending me a bunch of questions and calling me asking random fantasy questions since they don’t watch football and are only in it for the money. Hope you visit NYC soon. Ok bye.

### 10. Punta Gorda Floridiots 

You’re 0-3 but your team also looks decnent. I believe a resurgence is possible. Kinda feels like Rashadd Penny is droppable though? Idk just a thought.

### 11. Bijan Mustardson

Points for the name but you’re awful. Like don’t get me wrong I love Bijan. But the 1st pick felt aggressive to begin with. Maybe I am wrong. And im also still high on Waddle, but your team just feels so far from stable.

### 12. Mommas Milk Manthers

Zicca get off Onlyfans and pay attention. You did pretty decent week 1 taking down starchild lednerpants. However, your team has fucking crumbled in the two weeks since. You’re 1-2 – all is not lost. Also are we ever gonna meet dude? Kinda feels like you’re avoiding me at this point. I promise I don’t bite. I just don’t shut the fuck up.


## Good luck to all in their coming matchups, except Jkauff and Ledner. Fuck you both and fuck your Jets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
